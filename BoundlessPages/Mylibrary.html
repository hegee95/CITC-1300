      <h2>My Library</h2>
      <p>
        My library is a collection of stories and worlds that have shaped me. It's a place where I can escape into adventure,
        learn about history, and connect with characters who feel like old friends. From fantasy epics to thought-provoking
        non-fiction, each book on my shelf holds a special meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that a library is more than just a collection of books; it's a reflection of the reader's soul. It's a
        journey through different perspectives and a source of constant growth. I hope you enjoy exploring the books that are
        important to me as much as I do.

        <div class="synopsis">
          <p>In the kingdom of Adarlan, where magic has been outlawed and the king rules with an iron fist, eighteen-year-old
            assassin Celaena Sardothien is given a chance at freedom. Instead of rotting in the salt mines of Endovier, she's
            offered a deal: compete against other skilled criminals to become the King's Champion. If she wins, she'll earn
            her freedom after four years of service.</p>
          <p>Drawn into the opulent world of the royal court, Celaena finds herself facing dangerous trials, cunning rivals,
            and unexpected alliances. As she navigates the treacherous politics and deadly challenges, she also finds herself
            caught between the charming Captain of the Guard, Chaol Westfall, and the enigmatic Crown Prince Dorian
            Havilliard.</p>
          <p>But something sinister lurks within the castle walls. Assassins are being murdered, and a dark force threatens
            the kingdom. Celaena must not only survive the competition but also uncover the truth behind the growing evil
            before it consumes everything she holds dear.</p>

          <p>In a world where dragons and their riders hold immense power, twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail's life is upended
            when her commanding general mother forces her to join the dragon riders quadrant at Basgiath War College.
            Physically smaller and seemingly less capable than her peers, Violet faces near-certain death in the brutal and
            competitive training.</p>
          <p>Basgiath is a place where bonds with dragons are forged, alliances are fragile, and survival is a daily struggle.
            Violet must overcome her physical limitations, navigate treacherous politics, and earn the respect of both her
            fellow riders and the formidable dragons themselves. Among them is Xaden Riorson, the wing leader and son of the
            rebellion leader her mother executed – a man Violet has every reason to fear and distrust, yet finds herself
            increasingly drawn to.</p>

          <p>Twelve-year-old Meggie Folchart lives a quiet life with her father, Mo, a bookbinder with a secret. Mo has the rare and dangerous ability to read characters out of books, literally bringing them to life. This power comes at a cost: when a character is read out, someone from the real world is pulled into the book in their place.

            Their peaceful existence is shattered when a sinister character named Capricorn, whom Mo accidentally read out of a book called Inkheart years ago, tracks them down. Capricorn wants Mo to read out another dangerous creature from the same book. To protect Meggie and uncover the secrets of his power, Mo is forced to confront his past and the terrifying characters he unleashed.
            
            Meggie soon finds herself caught in a thrilling and perilous adventure, venturing into the world of Inkheart itself. She discovers her own connection to the magic of books and must learn to navigate the dangers of a world where stories come to life, encountering fantastical creatures, treacherous villains, and the blurred lines between reality and fiction. With the help of a quirky storyteller and a brave fairy, Meggie and Mo must find a way to put the characters back where they belong and reclaim their own lives.
