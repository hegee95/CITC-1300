      <h2>My Library</h2>
      <p>
        My library is a collection of stories and worlds that have shaped me. It's a place where I can escape into adventure,
        learn about history, and connect with characters who feel like old friends. From fantasy epics to thought-provoking
        non-fiction, each book on my shelf holds a special meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that a library is more than just a collection of books; it's a reflection of the reader's soul. It's a
        journey through different perspectives and a source of constant growth. I hope you enjoy exploring the books that are
        important to me as much as I do.

          <p>In the kingdom of Adarlan, where magic has been outlawed and the king rules with an iron fist, eighteen-year-old
            assassin Celaena Sardothien is given a chance at freedom. Instead of rotting in the salt mines of Endovier, she's
            offered a deal: compete against other skilled criminals to become the King's Champion. If she wins, she'll earn
            her freedom after four years of service.</p>
          <p>Drawn into the opulent world of the royal court, Celaena finds herself facing dangerous trials, cunning rivals,
            and unexpected alliances. As she navigates the treacherous politics and deadly challenges, she also finds herself
            caught between the charming Captain of the Guard, Chaol Westfall, and the enigmatic Crown Prince Dorian
            Havilliard.</p>
          <p>But something sinister lurks within the castle walls. Assassins are being murdered, and a dark force threatens
            the kingdom. Celaena must not only survive the competition but also uncover the truth behind the growing evil
            before it consumes everything she holds dear.</p>

          <p>In a world where dragons and their riders hold immense power, twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail's life is upended
            when her commanding general mother forces her to join the dragon riders quadrant at Basgiath War College.
            Physically smaller and seemingly less capable than her peers, Violet faces near-certain death in the brutal and
            competitive training.</p>
          <p>Basgiath is a place where bonds with dragons are forged, alliances are fragile, and survival is a daily struggle.
            Violet must overcome her physical limitations, navigate treacherous politics, and earn the respect of both her
            fellow riders and the formidable dragons themselves. Among them is Xaden Riorson, the wing leader and son of the
            rebellion leader her mother executed – a man Violet has every reason to fear and distrust, yet finds herself
            increasingly drawn to.</p>
          <p>As Violet fights to survive the grueling training and the deadly missions beyond the academy walls, she uncovers
            dangerous secrets about the war they are fighting and the true nature of the dragons. She must forge an unbreakable
            bond with her own dragon, learn to harness her unique abilities, and decide who to trust in a world where loyalty is a
            luxury and betrayal can be fatal. The fate of their kingdom may very well rest on her small shoulders.</p>

Mo has the rare and dangerous ability to read characters out of books, literally bringing them to life.
