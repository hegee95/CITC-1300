            <h2>Book to Movie Adaptations</h2>
            <article class="adaptation">
                <h3>Lord Of The Rings</h3>
                <p>World Building and Detail: Tolkien's novel is known for it's deep world-building. The book includes extensive histories, languages, and cultures of Middle-earth, which are only briefly touched upon in the film. For example, the book includes detailed desciptions of the Shire, the Rivendell council, and the lore of the Elves, Dwarves, and Men, all of which are only hinted at in the movie due to time constraints.</p>
                <p>Character Omission and Changes: One notable omission is the character Tom Bombadil. In the book, Bombadil plays an important role early in the journey, but his character is entirely omitted in the film, likely due to his episodic nature and lack of direct influence on the main plot. Additionally, Arwen, who in the book has a minor role, is given a more prominent part in the movie to provide a romantic subplot with Aragorn, helping increase the emotional stakes.</p>
                <p>Tone and Pacing: The book has a slower, more meditative pace, often delving into characters' inner thoughts and the environment. The film, on the other hand, is more action-driven and uses cinematic techniques like epic battle scenes and stunning landscapes to maintain momentum.</p>

            <article class="adaptation">
                <h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>
                <p>Character Development: In the book, we see more of Harry's inner thoughts and background, particularly his struggles with being an orphan and the discovery of his magical heritage. The film focuses more on visual spectacle, often glossing over Harry’s emotional depth and his relationships with his friends, Ron and Hermione. One key moment from the book, where Harry gets to know the history of his parents, is condensed in the film.</p>
                <p>Omitted Scenes: The movie leaves out some key moments from the book, such as Harry’s encounter with the ghost Nearly Headless Nick and the detailed process of how he learns about Quidditch. These scenes help build the world of Hogwarts and introduce some of the whimsical elements that made the books so beloved.</p>
                <p>Visual Representation: The film captures the magical world beautifully, translating the Hogwarts castle, Diagon Alley, and the Quidditch matches into vivid, fantastical visuals. The book’s descriptions are rich, but the movie elevates the magic with special effects, creating a visually stunning version of the wizarding world.</p>

            <article class="adaptation">
                <h3>The Hunger Games</h3>
                <p>Narrative Perspective: The book is written from Katniss’ first-person point of view, which allows readers to experience her internal struggles and moral dilemmas as she navigates the Games. The movie, however, uses a third-person perspective, providing a broader view of the events but losing some of the intimate connection to Katniss' thoughts and feelings.</p>
                <p>Violence and Death: The book doesn’t shy away from the brutal violence and death in the Games, often detailing the psychological toll it takes on Katniss. The movie, while still intense, tones down some of the violence for a PG-13 rating, and certain deaths (such as the death of the young girl, Rue) are presented more subtly on screen.</p>
                <p>Characterization of Peeta: In the book, Peeta’s internal conflict is more prominently featured, especially his feelings of unrequited love for Katniss. The film does a good job showcasing their evolving relationship, but Peeta’s more nuanced internal thoughts, especially his vulnerability, are harder to capture.</p>
                <p>The Mockingjay Symbol: The book emphasizes the Mockingjay pin as a symbol of rebellion and hope, but the movie doesn’t fully capture the significance of this symbol until later films in the series. Its importance is more implied in the first movie than explored in depth.</p>
